# eqParser
I created this because eval in python is dangerous. So if you want an equation parser that is not dangerous, consider using eqParser to parse simple equations with +, -, *, /, and ^.

# Adding eqParser to your code
If you want to add eqParser to your code, just copy the Python code in the code.py file, and paste it into your projects.

# How long did this take me?
